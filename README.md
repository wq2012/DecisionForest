## Overview

This package implements the decision tree and decision forest techniques in C++,
and can be compiled with MEX and called by MATLAB/Octave.
The algorithm is highly efficient, and has been used in [multiple publications](#copyright-and-citation).

This library is also available at MathWorks MATLAB Central:
